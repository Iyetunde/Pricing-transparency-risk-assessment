# Pricing-transparency-risk-assessment
A Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Analytical Risk Assessment

📌 Objective

To assess pricing transparency and volatility using structured data analysis, and evaluate whether observed pricing patterns align with governance principles of predictability, proportionality, and oversight.

🎯 Governance Lens Applied

This project evaluates pricing behavior through a GRC framework by examining:

Predictability: Do prices change in a logical and consistent manner?

Proportionality: Are service-level premiums justified and consistent?

Volatility Concentration: Are there high-risk zones of elevated unpredictability?

Transparency Risk Indicators: Do pricing patterns raise oversight concerns?

🔍 Key Findings

Pricing generally follows demand-aligned logic, with higher costs closer to departure.

Business class premiums are proportionally consistent and relatively stable.

When normalized by duration, non-stop flights reflect logical time-efficiency pricing.

Elevated relative volatility was observed in short booking windows and economy class.

🛡 Overall Risk Rating

Pricing Transparency Risk: Moderate

While pricing structures demonstrate logical alignment with service tiers and demand behavior, localized volatility indicates the need for ongoing monitoring rather than structural remediation.

🧰 Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

Risk Management Implications

The results show that pricing generally follows logical patterns based on service level and demand. However, prices are more unstable in short booking windows and in economy class. These areas may need closer monitoring.

From a governance perspective, this highlights the need for:

Regular monitoring of areas where price changes are more unpredictable

Using data to support risk ratings

Making oversight decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions
